## Accessibility

Added ARIA attribute to all links on HTML pages. This helps people with disabilities understand what a link is and its purpose.

I used the semantic HTML markup  to help the browser understand the context of the content and also help accessibility for users with disabilities.

Iâ€™ve used `role` and `alt` Attributes on all the background images or images used to explain what the images are.
